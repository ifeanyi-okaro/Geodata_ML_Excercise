# Geodata_ML_Excercise

Everything is explained step by step in the Jupyter Notebook/ Html file.

The initial data file contains the files to be used when you want to run the notebook from the beginning.

The Noise Data is too big, so it was zipped seperately as Laermkarten_HH_2018-11-19.

The results and transformed file contains The Jupyter notebook, Model and already transformed data.

The final dataframe is named Enrinched_Transformed_test_final_data. It contained the appended columns.

You can ask me additional questions anytime.
